# ProjChart
Current real prod project is:
https://redcap.stanford.edu/redcap_v9.9.1/Design/online_designer.php?pid=19520


NEW PROJECT:
https://redcap.stanford.edu/redcap_v9.9.1/index.php?pid=20110

This EM will coordinate between 2 REDCap projects.  EM must be installed on both projects and configured as either "MSG DB" or "MAIN PROJECT"


## TODO:

- Make a code entry page:
    https://codepen.io/DaniRC/pen/PowwwjZ

    that accepts zip and newuniq codes
    - validates against external project (MSG Database / 20165 in production)


- Configure multilanguage
